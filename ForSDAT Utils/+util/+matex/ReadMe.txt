This package is a remnant of an erra I spent learning to use Matlab and had no symbolic math toolbox
It's too much of a hassle to get rid of it now, so there it, worthless piece of ancient code...
The only benefit of using this package is that it exposes a unified interface for both symbolic functions and curve fitting objects
a unified API can be easily achieved using closures so...
Bottom line, don't use it..
